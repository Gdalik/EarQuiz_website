Whether you make a living from music or this is your hobby; whether you are a seasoned sound professional or a student, 
trying to develop or master the ability to aurally recognize frequency bands; 
whether you are an audio specialist/artist of any kind (performer, producer, recording/mixing/mastering/live sound engineer, audio designer, DJ, etc.) or
just someone who wants to teach himself/herself how to adjust an audio system with equalizer by ear, this application
is for you! Educators in the audio industry may use this software to [produce superb quality training and test materials][1] for their students almost in no time.

This application is based on (and deeply inspired by) the world-renowned *[Golden Ears][2]* method of David Moulton, 
whose course is half dedicated to building this essential critical listening skill.

The overall training process involves ongoing learning and testing yourself. In the *Learn* mode, you listen to the [pink noise][5]
or music (or other external audio) excerpts with switched off and on 1-octave or 1/3-octave graphic EQ, boosting or cutting frequency bands within
certain spectral ranges. Then in the *Test* mode you are given a sequence of 10 similar examples, where you try to guess,
which frequencies are boosted or cut, and you get scored.

The program is [Free Software][3], distributed under [GNU GPL v3 License][4]. 
It is free for any use, either personal or commercial!

### Features

- Internal pink noise generator or any external audio file in WAV, AIFF, FLAC or MP3 format as audio source.

example fade in/out duration).
- Auto-saving trimmed ranges and example/slice lengths for different audio sources.
- Exporting learning and test audio file packages in WAV, AIFF, FLAC, MP3, or OGG format. 
- Audio format converter.
- Reading M3U, M3U8, PLS, XSPF playlists supported.
