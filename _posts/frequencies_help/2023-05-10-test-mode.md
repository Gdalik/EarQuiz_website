The **Test** mode is activated by clicking the corresponding button on the main window or
by selecting **Controls \| Test Mode** from the main menu. The keyboard shortcut for it is  **Ctrl+T** (on Windows) or 
**âŒ˜T** (on macOS).<br />

The application will normalize the audio if needed. When you use an external audio file as a source, the program will 
read and crop it before that. Then the playback of the first example will start automatically.

To complete a test, you should do ten examples in a row. [Use sliders' handles to input the guessed answers][1].
This can be done during or after the playback of each example. Once your answer is accepted, the right answer 
will be labelled and highlighted in green immediately. The ![]({{ site.urlimg }}Frequencies_Help/next-example.png)**Next Example** control/button
will become enabled so that you could proceed.  Unlike in the **Learn** mode, the sliders with changed handles' positions (the user input)
may differ from the highlighted ones (the right answer).

You can play and stop a current example as many times as you want with the **Play** and the **Stop** buttons/controls correspondingly.
Any time you do not give the exact right answer, it is highly recommended to play the example once again for better training effectiveness.

When the mode is activated, the **Exercise / Score Information** window is shown. It contains useful information about a current test:
examples count, test status (in progress, finished with pass/fail or canceled), the user and the right answers, and scoring.

The score calculation is quite straightforward. The maximum score for an example is 10, and the maximum total score for a test is 100.
When a user's answer is equal to the right answer, he or she gets 10 out of 10. Each 1-octave error subtracts 1 score point. Each 1/3-octave
error subtracts 0.33 points. The boost/cut mistake takes off 2 points. In case of dual-band exercise, the scores for each frequency band
in an example are count separately, with 5 being the maximum and 0 being the minimum for a frequency band. And then a maximum possible sum is taken as the 
score for the example.

The following table shows the expected score range for different types of exercises (EQ patterns):

| Exercise / EQ Pattern Type | Expected Score |
|:---------------------------|:--------------:|
| 1-octave bands, single-band|  85&mdash;95   |
| 1/3-octave bands, single-band|  75&mdash;90   |
| 1-octave bands, dual-band|  70&mdash;85   |
| 1/3-octave bands, dual-band|  65&mdash;80   |

To pass the test, you must get a total score which is 5 points below the lower end of the expected score range or higher. If your score is higher than
the upper end of the range, you get the *passed+* mark.

Changing EQ settings is disabled in this mode. Loading another audio source or switching to another mode would cancel 
the current test. Selecting another EQ Pattern would reset it as well.
