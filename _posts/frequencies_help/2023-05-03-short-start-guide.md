Let's get started!
1. With pink noise, selected as an audio source, [switch the application to the Learn mode][1], using the corresponding
button on the main window, the main menu item or the keyboard shortcut, or just by changing an [EQ slider][2] handle position.
2. With pink noise examples, played in [the Learn mode][1]:
     * [Check/set up your audio playback system][4]. 
     * [Adjust the volume level][5].
3. [Make sure the frequency range/response of your playback audio system is decent enough][3].
4. In [the Learn mode][1], with pink noise as an audio source and the first [equalization pattern][6],
go through all the possible examples.
5. Activate [the Test mode][7], and try to pass a test.
6. Repeat the learn-test cycle with the second and the third EQ patterns, using pink noise.
7. Save the volume level with the feature, available from the **Volume Slider** 
right-click context menu or from the **Audio** menu of the main menu. Then reduce the volume level by 10-15 dB.
8. [Load, preview and trim][8] some of your favorite commercially mastered music tracks of different
styles/genres.
9. Uncheck the **Controls \| Start Playing After Loading Track in Preview Mode** option in the main menu if checked.
10. Restore the volume level with the feature, available from the **Volume Slider** 
right-click context menu or from the **Audio** menu of the main menu.
11. Do the learn-test exercises with the first three EQ patterns, using prepared music tracks.
12. Go through the other EQ patterns with both pink noise and music audio sources, thus increasing the difficulty step by step.
Adjust the volume level where needed.
13. After becoming familiar with the built-in EQ patterns, try practicing with custom [EQ Settings][9].
14. Explore more features, read more documentation (if needed).
