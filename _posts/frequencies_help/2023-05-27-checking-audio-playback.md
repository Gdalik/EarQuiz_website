Obvious, but important: make sure your audio system is switched on, and the playback audio path is working properly.
By default, the program uses your system sound output device. But you can easily switch to any available 
audio playback device, selecting **Audio \| Audio Device** menu item from the main menu.

Initially, the audio source is set to **Pink noise** so that the software would not require any external files to 
get up and running. And it is usually the best starting point for your practice session. So, make sure the corresponding
option is selected in the **Audio Source** window.

Are you ready to hear the sound :-)? Just click the 
**Learn** mode button **or** change the position of any EQ sliders' handle by dragging/clicking on it, which will switch the application
to the *Learn* mode automatically. After some processing ([peak normalization](#peak-normalization) and equalization) and loading, which usually takes fractions of second
on contemporary machines, the playback of an example should start.

*Here, you may want to proceed with the training process. But I suggest that we should **adjust your
audio system** first.*
